What Is Growth Mindset to me 

To me, growth mindset is setting a goal or a plethora of goals that you have set yourself and planning to achieve those goals and those goals can be anything professional or not. Setting challenges that will help you reach to you're end goals.

I use 3 different ways to remind myself to keep myself in a growth mindset, one of the most used methods is by making notes on my phone and reading/going over them to remind myself of these self made goals. You could make a physical note and place it somewhere and read/go over it and say to yourself if you have met the end of these goals that you have created for yourself. lastly you could always ask someone to help remind you of your selected goals that will help you make sure to follow that path (figuratively)
