# Reading Notes
Hi, I'm Dominic Tootill-Giudice but for easier communication it's normally Dom. I can come off as a bit of a nerd as I love talking about games and any/all news about gaming, as well as movies and series's such as DC, Marvel, and star wars. Outside of that I can be a bit anti-social but meetings new people becuase I can be a bit anxious but that changes after a while. 

What Is Growth Mindset to me. 



To me, growth mindset is setting a goal or a plethora of goals that you have set yourself and planning to achieve those goals and those goals can be anything professional or not. Setting challenges that will help you reach to you're end goals.

Many methods to remind yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset:

:Make a note on your phone

:Make a physical note

:Someone can remind you
